# Notes

- compute_operations.py calculates the amount of FLOPS -> for performance measurements
- Net_visiable.py visualizes the constructed network
- test_parse.py is only for testing, the actual args are handled in train.py
- evaluation of model possible in utils/evaluate.py to get mIOU (only deeplabv3p supported)
- multiple data loader not working 
- Get VOCDevKit from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lyuxinshuai/vocdevkit
- Get Med Dataset from here https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3193805/wiki/89480
